              <p>Good Morning, Team Zahra!</p>

              <p>
                As you've heard in our latest Styling News announcement, all of styling will be ramping up
                to 4.75 Fixes Per Hour. We’ve been delighting 60 customers a week
                (at the 15 hour minimum) and I’m confident we can do the same for 67+.
                Keep this email on hand as it's filled to
                the brim with helpful tips and tricks for our slow increase over
                the next 8 weeks. It's not as overwhelming as it sounds!
              </p>

              <p>
                Here's the plan:
              </p>

              <table>
                  <tbody>
                      <tr>

                <br />

                <strong>Goal: Productivity</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Let's go back to basics-  get your Stitch Fix styling-only area ready and set
                    your schedule for the time you feel your best self
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Plan ahead: carve out blocks of styling time. A 2 hour "groove" is highly
                    recommended so you can get in the styling zone without distractions
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="box-section">
                <img src="/assets/images/stitchfix/check.png" width="25" height="25" alt="check" class="box-section__icon" />
                <br />

                <strong>Goal: Balancing quality and efficiency</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Use a timer: Break down your styling to three zones of
                    <ol>
                      <li>Familiarizing yourself with client's history/Pinterest/requests (~2 mins)</li>
                      <li>Pulling pieces</li>
                      <li>Note writing</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Each Fix should take about 12 minutes from start to finish -
                    see which areas you can improve your timing on.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="box-section">
                <strong>Styling tips that work</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Anchor pieces: start with a bottom or dress as your jumping off point</li>
                    <li>Hone in on your vision for the Fix after choosing your anchor - stick to it and don't go back to scrolling!</li>
                    <li>Choose high match scores (over 40%, preferably)</li>
                    <li>Use advanced filters to add variety to your client's closet and match their preferences</li>
                    <li>Keep an open mind and be confident - trust your creative styling prowess.</li>
                </ul>

                <br />

                <strong>Strategies that don't work</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>"Burst styling" styling and then writing notes later - data shows it causes lower AOV and fph</li>
                  <li><5 minute styling - data shows this leads to low client satisfaction</li>
                  <li>Holding Fixes in your queue in hopes of a certain piece - trust the algorithm! </li>
                  <li>Working off the clock - we want you to be paid for your time and never want you working off the clock </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

                <strong>Remember our Client Promise</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Every client should feel like their Fix is a personalized experience, giving them effortless style</li>
                  <li>Leave your personal style at the door - always address requests and preferences</li>
                  <li>Continue building a connection! </li>
                </ul>
