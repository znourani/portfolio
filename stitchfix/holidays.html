            <h2>A Holiday Challenge - winner announced next Friday!</h2>

            <p>Happy Friday, Star Stylers!</p>

            <p>
              The holiday spirit is in the air and I, for one, can't wait for all the festivities.
              Now if only all the gifts would buy, wrap, and prep themselves&hellip;
            </p>

              Before the eggnog starts flowing, let's make sure our clients have those fabulous pieces to
              look and feel their best during this busy time of year. As a way to keep our Fixes fresh,
              I've set some goals for each day this week. Upload the pictures to our team Yammer page
              (or send to me directly) for a drawing at the end of the week! Each item is worth 1 entry
              - everyone meeting their Fix goal is eligible!
            </p>
