              As this is an initial email reaching out to the stylist, I don't want to assume her situation outside work or insinuate lack of effort in styling. The goal of this email will be a conversation to conduct an honest review of feedback and/or styling habits.

            <p>Hi there, Stitch Star!</p>

            <p>
              I hope all is well! You've always met (and exceeded!) your styling goals so I wanted to reach out to see
              how we can work together to make sure we continue to deliver the experience your clients
              have come to expect in a timely fasion.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Fewer Fixes sent can cause a downward trend in keep rate and AOV so let's talk this week to set some goals and get those numbers back in the green!
            </p>

            <p>
              Let me know what days work best!
            </p>

            <p>
              Thanks in advance, 
              <br>
              Zahra
