              <p> SUBJECT: Action Item - Metrics Check In </p>
              <p>Hi Sarah!</p>

              <p>
                Hope you're having a great Tuesday!
              </p>

              <p>
                I wanted to check in with the metrics update today.  You are
                starting to trend in the red for AOV again with a missed
                expectation on the FPH ramp up as well. Here's what I see on my end:

              <p>I wanted to see if you are using the styling best practices we worked through in our TB two weeks ago, or what factors you think are contributing to the decrease. </p>

              <p>For more consistency in both KR and AOV quality metrics, be sure that you maintain the price point and really trust the algorithm. I know that we sometimes want to choose based on our style but do what's best for the client and lean on the resources and tools that we have in place.</p>

              <p>I'd love to hear your outlook - please send your insights on methods to speed up to the 4.75 FPH goal by EOD Thursday. We want you in the green for FPH by next week's update, and for AOV by the week after! Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
